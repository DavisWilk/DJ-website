            <p>Currently based in Hong Kong, Wilkinho is a Los Angeles native whoâ€™s been DJing and organizing parties
                throughout Los Angeles, New York, and Amsterdam since 2008. With an endless appetite for discovering new
                (and old) music, Wilkinho is known for his extensive library of Funk, Hip-hop, RnB, Disco, and House
                music. He also has an intimate relationship with 90's Hip-hop & House cultures, and specializes in
                genre-crossing nostalgia invoking mixes of old and new.
                <br>

                Prior to moving to Hong Kong, he spent the majority of his weekends playing at events, parties, and
                clubs in Los Angeles (and abroad). A resident DJ of the Chateau Marmont for over 2 years, he has been
                tasked with providing the soundtrack to some of the most exclusive and elusive parties LA has to offer.
                He has played alongside acts such as Shlohmo, RL Grime, Jacques Greene, DJDS, DEEJ, Peanut Butter Wolf,
                Lil B, BAAUER, Thundercat, and Mark Farina. </p>
